# CRKD


Classification codes on CReg-KD (Modify the labels to label distribution for brain age prediction by reference to our previous study (Here)[https://github.com/podismine/BrainAgeReg])

The datasets were divided into a train set and a test set in the code at present since there is little effect on the performance of our experiments. You can also modify to use a validation set.
